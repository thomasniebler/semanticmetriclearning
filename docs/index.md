## Reference Implementations
### LSML
For LSML, we used a modified implementation from the one in the [metric_learn](https://github.com/all-umass/metric-learn) package.
It can be found in src/metric_learn/lsml.py

We added a diminishing factor to the matrix regularization term, as Euclidean distances on a unit sphere tend to become
rather small in comparison to the trace of a 100x100 matrix. The initial matrix M_0 was chosen as the Identity matrix,
since we want to modify the cosine measure.

### GloVe
We used the [published code of GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) to create the tag embeddings.
We used the predefined values of alpha=0.75 and x_max=100.

## Vector Embeddings
These are the datasets that we used for our experiments.

### Delicious
The Delicious tagging dataset is [publicly available](http://www.zubiaga.org/datasets/socialbm0311).
The generated word embeddings can be retrieved from [PUT THAT IN] 

### BibSonomy
The BibSonomy tagging data can be retrieved from [the BibSonomy homepage](https://www.kde.cs.uni-kassel.de/bibsonomy/dumps/).
We also provide the generated word embeddings as a public download at [PUT THAT IN] 

### WikiGlove
Pennington et al. made some of their vector collections [publicly available](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
Specifically, we used to GloVe6B corpus, which is generated from a Wikipedia dump from 2014 and the Gigaword5 corpus.

### WikiNav
The WikiNav vectors are publicly available at [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Navigation_Vectors].
Specifically, we used the 100-dimensional vectors from [https://figshare.com/articles/Wikipedia_Vectors/3146878], created
with data ranging from 01-01-2017 till 31-01-2017.

## Human Intuition Datasets
The Human Intuition Datasets (HIDs) can be retrieved as preprocessed pandas-friendly csv files 
from [http://www.thomas-niebler.de/dataset-collection-for-evaluating-semantic-relatedness/]
or from the corresponding original locations.
